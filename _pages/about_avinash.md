Hi! I am a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin specializing in computer architecture and computer systems. My research focuses on applying hardware and software techniques to tackle challenges in modern quantum computing systems.

Previously, as a Senior GPU Power Architect, I worked with cross-functional teams to evaluate architectural trade-offs for next-generation discrete GPUs at NVIDIA. This experience was preceded by my undergraduate education in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, which I completed at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India.
