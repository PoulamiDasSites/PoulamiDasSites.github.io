Hi! I am a 2nd year masterâ€™s student specializing in computer architecture. My research focuses on applying hardware/software techniques to address challenges in modern computing, with a particular interest in memory systems, ML and quantum computing.

<!-- Previously, as a Senior GPU Power Architect, I worked with cross-functional teams to evaluate architectural trade-offs for next-generation discrete GPUs at NVIDIA. This experience was preceded by my undergraduate education in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, which I completed at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India. -->
