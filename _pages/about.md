I am an Assistant Professor (and a Fellow of the AMD Chair in Computer Engineering) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Prior to joining UT Austin, I completed my PhD at Georgia Tech where I was advised by Prof. Moin Qureshi. My research focuses on software and architecture for improving the reliability of quantum computers. I am also interested in computer architecture, memory systems, and emerging technologies.

I am actively looking for highly motivated undergraduate and graduate students to join my research group. Please email me at poulami.das@utexas.edu if you are interested.

I am teaching ECE-382V: Quantum Computing Systems Software/Architecture Perspective in Fall 2023 and scheduled to teach it again in Fall 2024. I will be teaching ECE-460N: Computer Architecture in Spring 2024.
