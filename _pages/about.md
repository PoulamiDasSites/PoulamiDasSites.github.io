I am an Assistant Professor and a Fellow of the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Chair in Computer Engineering in the Chandra Family Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. 

My research focuses on software and architecture for improving the reliability of quantum computers. I am also interested in computer architecture, memory systems, and emerging technologies. 

Before joining UT Austin as a faculty, I obtained my PhD degree from Georgia Tech and MS degree from UT Austin.  

I am actively looking for highly motivated undergraduate and graduate students to join my research group. Please email me if you are interested.
