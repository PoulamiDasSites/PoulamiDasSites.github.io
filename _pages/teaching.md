# I am teaching ECE-382V: Quantum Computing Systems Software/Architecture Perspective in Fall 2023 and scheduled to teach it again in Fall 2024. 
## Course Overview:
Quantum computers promise to speedup many important applications, some of which are almost impossible to solve even on the worldâ€™s most powerful supercomputers in a reasonable amount of time. Today, quantum computers with a few hundred qubits are already available, and qubit counts are expected to cross a few thousands in the coming years. Quantum computing is an interdisciplinary field with topics ranging from applications and algorithms to programming, compilers, systems, architecture, and physical devices. This course will focus on the architecture and software stack that translates the mathematical properties of quantum states that algorithms rely on into state changes on the physical qubits, much like how general-purpose computers require compilers, micro-architecture, and system-level solutions for functionality and high performance.

# I will be teaching ECE-460N: Computer Architecture in Spring 2024.
## Course Overview:
Examine characteristics of instruction set architecture and microarchitecture; physical and virtual memory; caches and cache design; interrupts and exceptions; integer and floating-point arithmetic; I/O processing; buses; pipelining, out-of-order execution, branch prediction, and other performance enhancements; design trade-offs; and case studies of commercial microprocessors. Explore behavioral-level design of a microarchitecture in a laboratory setting.
